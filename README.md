# SS13-Faithful-Remake-Lost-In-Space-Godot-Engine-
Trying to remake ss13 as a whole mostly TG style but I'm keeping it open for everyone like ss13 does unlike the other ones this is just going to be a basic template for people to make their own station and or just use it as a base for any ss13 game


Atmos and mutiplayer will be added after i make all the basic stuff
What we have right now 
Tile Movement, Basic lighting/Shadows, AutoTiles and Pushing
Your free to add to the project to help me with getting this template ready
